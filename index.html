      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm studying to become a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Wilson, NC</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Computer games, reading, cooking, and walking my dog</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not entirely sure, I started becoming interested in coding when I began learning about ethical hacking. I really enjoyed that, and I've always been interested in computers, so something in the same vein.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Raleigh, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always wanted to learn to code and web development seems to be a pretty good place to start. The job market seems good and even if I don't make a career of it, the skills will be useful regardless.</p>
